      <h1>My Vacation Spot: Japan</h1>

      <h2>Why Japan?</h2>
      <p>
        I would love to visit Japan because it combines modern innovation with deep cultural history. As someone interested in technology and design, I admire Japan's leadership in robotics, transportation, and architecture. At the same time, I'm fascinated by its temples, traditions, and landscapes.
      </p>

      <h2>Places I Want to Visit</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tokyo</strong> – Explore Akihabara's tech scene, visit robotics exhibits, and ride the bullet train.</li>
        <li><strong>Kyoto</strong> – Visit traditional temples, gardens, and historical districts.</li>
        <li><strong>Osaka</strong> – Enjoy street food and explore the Dotonbori nightlife.</li>
        <li><strong>Mount Fuji</strong> – See Japan’s most famous mountain and possibly hike it.</li>
        <li><strong>Hiroshima</strong> – Learn about its history and visit the Peace Memorial Park.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why It Connects to My Interests</h2>
      <p>
        As a future mechanical engineer, I’m inspired by Japan’s work in robotics and precision engineering. I would love to see how companies like Toyota, Honda, and Sony innovate with mechanical systems. Visiting Japan would let me experience these technologies up close while also learning from a culture that values discipline, creativity, and attention to detail.
