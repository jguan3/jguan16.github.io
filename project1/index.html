    <h2>What do I see myself doing in the future?</h2>
    <p>After graduating from high school and college, I want to become a mechanical engineer with a focus on robotics and control systems. I've always been fascinated by how machines move and respond to their environment, especially in fields like automation and manufacturing. It amazes me how robots can perform complex tasks with precision, whether it's assembling tiny electronics or navigating through rough terrain. I'm especially interested in the systems that control how machines react and adapt in real time. I want to work on designing the mechanical parts and control algorithms that make these machines smarter and more efficient. One day, I hope to help develop advanced robotic systems that improve how we work, build, and interact with technology.</p>
    <h2>Employers that interest me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>General Electric (GE)</li>
      <li>Siemens</li>
      <li>Boston Dynamics</li>
      <li>Tesla</li>
      <li>John Deere</li>
      <li>Caterpillar Inc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am drawn to these employers because they focus on creating cutting-edge mechanical and robotic systems that match my passion for innovation. They also provide excellent opportunities for career growth and professional development within their organizations.</p>
